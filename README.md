#Visual continuity
"Transitioning between two visual states should be clear, smooth and effortless and not confuse the user. A well-designed transition does the heavy lifting and enables the user to clearly understand where their attention should be focused. A transition has three categories of elements:
Incoming elements - whether newly generated or translated into the scene, these items need to be introduced or re-established.
Outgoing elements - elements that are no longer relevant to the new context must be removed from the scene in an appropriate manner.
Shared elements - elements that persist from the start to end of a transition. They can be as subtle as a single icon or become dominant as a gallery image grows to fit the screen."
